      <p className="">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recipe is a formula of ingredients and a list of
        instructions for creating prepared foods. It is used to control quality,
        quantity, and food costs in a foodservice operation. A recipe may be
        simple to complex based on the requirements of the operation and the
        intended user. For example, an experienced chef may need a recipe with
        only a few details, while a beginner cook may need more information
        about ingredients, preparation steps, cooking times and temperatures,
        visual cues, and equipment requirements. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recipes are formatted differently depending on the
        author and the intended use. Professional chefs record recipes in pocket
        notebooks, binders, or digital devices, using simple to complex details,
        depending on the type of recipe and the experience level of the chef.
        Information might include ingredients, prep steps, kitchen notes, and
        hand-drawn plate presentations. Recipes for the general consumer must be
        written with the assumption that the intended user knows very little
        about food preparation. When writing recipes that others will use in
        your kitchen, provide as much information so that anyone who is
        preparing, inexperienced or skilled, can easily understand. Include
        information on ingredients, prep steps for fabricating or measuring,
        cooking instructions, recipe yield, and required equipment.

      <h5>Recipe Limitations</h5>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s not uncommon for two cooks when preparing the
        same recipe to end up with different results. There are many variables
        involved in the cooking process, and no recipe is foolproof.
        Ingredients, like fresh vegetables, often lack uniformity, and
        substitutions may be required that produce different results. Tools and
        equipment vary from one kitchen to another, affecting cooking times and
        outcomes. For example, an oven that is not calibrated accurately may
        take a longer time when baking a cake, or sauté pans made of different
        metals (aluminum or stainless steel) may not cook as efficiently or
        produce the right browning effect. Recipes cannot account for inaccurate
        measuring or misunderstanding of directions. Experience and proper
        judgment help to produce consistent results over time.

      <h5>Recipe Tips</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Read recipes from beginning to end, to understand the steps</li>
        <li>Note information on ingredient prep, techniques, and other tips</li>
        <li>If needed convert the volume of the recipe</li>
        <li>Gather ingredients, equipment, and tools</li>
        <li>
          Apply common sense when measuring ingredients to be sure you have the
          correct quantity and ratio
        </li>
        <li>
          Use basic judgment when preparing; for example, do you understand the
          basic steps for preparing a stock? If not, read up on the steps and
          tips to preparing it before you start
        </li>
        <li>
          Observe oven temperatures, cooking times, and specific equipment
        </li>
        <li>
          Take written notes of any changes you made in measurements, cooking
          times and temperatures, or procedures so that you can reproduce the
          recipe with similar results
        </li>
      </ul>
